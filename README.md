# Source-code-of-IQA-software
IQA is a software used for the quantitative analysis (including chemical imaging) of optical sensors.
The executable (.exe) file (can be run independently on Windows system) of IQA (Version 1.0.0) has been released. 
The method of using IQA was shown in the file of "Simple demonstration of using the IQA software.pdf".
Two images and a calibration file shown in the PDF file were provided in the folder of 'Demonstration files'.
The code of IQA is open source (MIT License). It was developed using Python 3.8 64-bit.
The two folders (named 'gui' and 'img' in the 'source code' folder) are the dependency files of code, including the '.ui' files developed by Pyside2 and the image files shown in GUI interfaces. The 'tubiao1.ico' file is the icon of the software.
